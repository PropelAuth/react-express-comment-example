## React/Express comment system with authentication

### Technologies used

 - React for the frontend
 - Material UI for styling the frontend
 - SWR for loading data
 - Express for the backend
 - Sequelize as an ORM
 - Sqlite as the DB
 - PropelAuth for authentication

### Status

This version does not yet have authentication. That will be added
in the next commit.

The frontend displays a list of comments and allows users to post comments with a user specified username.

The backend has two api calls. One for listing comments, one for creating new comments.
